                <h2>Why Real-World Examples Matter</h2>
                <p>Learning from actual security incidents helps us understand how attacks happen, what the consequences are, and most importantly, how to prevent them. These case studies demonstrate that cybersecurity isn't just theory—it has real impacts on real people and businesses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Personal Security Examples</h2>
                
                <h3>Case Study 1: The Password Reuse Disaster</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Sarah used the same password for her email, banking, and social media accounts. When a forum she registered on years ago was breached, hackers obtained her email and password. They used these credentials to access her email, which gave them password reset access to her bank account.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> $8,000 stolen from her bank account, compromised social media accounts used to scam her friends, weeks of recovery time.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Never reuse passwords across accounts. Use a password manager to create and store unique passwords for each service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Use unique passwords, ✓ Enable 2FA, ✓ Use a password manager</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Case Study 2: The Phishing Email</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tom received an urgent email claiming to be from his bank, stating suspicious activity was detected on his account. The email looked legitimate, with the bank's logo and formatting. He clicked the link and entered his credentials on what appeared to be the bank's website.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Hackers gained access to his real bank account within hours, transferring funds before he realized it was a scam.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Always verify urgent requests by contacting the organization directly through official channels, never through links in emails.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Never click links in unsolicited emails, ✓ Look for red flags (urgency, poor grammar), ✓ Type website URLs directly into your browser</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Case Study 3: The Public Wi-Fi Snoop</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Jennifer connected to free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop and checked her bank balance. Unknown to her, a hacker had set up a fake Wi-Fi network with a similar name and was monitoring all traffic.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Her login credentials were intercepted, leading to unauthorized transactions.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Public Wi-Fi is inherently insecure. Use a VPN when accessing sensitive information on public networks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Use VPN on public Wi-Fi, ✓ Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on public networks, ✓ Verify network names with staff</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Martinez family installed a smart security camera system but never changed the default password. Hackers found their camera online and accessed the live feed, watching their daily routines.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Privacy violation, fear and anxiety, potential for targeted burglary.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Always change default passwords on IoT devices immediately after installation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Change default passwords, ✓ Keep firmware updated, ✓ Use strong, unique passwords, ✓ Enable 2FA</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Case Study 5: The Social Media Overshare</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Johnson family posted real-time vacation photos on social media with their location tagged. Burglars, monitoring local social media, knew the house was empty and broke in.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> $15,000 in stolen valuables, home damage, trauma.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Never post about vacations in real-time. Share photos after returning home.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Post vacation content after returning, ✓ Review privacy settings, ✓ Limit who can see your posts, ✓ Don't share your full address online</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Case Study 6: The Gaming Account Scam</h3>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A 12-year-old received a message in an online game offering free in-game currency. The link led to a fake login page that stole his credentials. The account was used to message other children with similar scams.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Lost access to gaming account, account used for scamming others, potential exposure of personal information.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Teach children about online scams and to never enter passwords on sites reached through links.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Educate children about scams, ✓ Monitor gaming activities, ✓ Enable parental controls, ✓ Use 2FA on gaming accounts</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A small medical practice received an email with an attached "invoice." An employee opened the attachment, which installed ransomware that encrypted all patient records. Hackers demanded $50,000 to unlock the files.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Business shut down for two weeks, $100,000 in recovery costs, regulatory fines for data protection violations, permanent loss of some data, damaged reputation.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Regular backups and employee training are essential. The practice had no recent backups and had to pay the ransom (which didn't guarantee full recovery).</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Regular offline backups, ✓ Employee security training, ✓ Email filtering, ✓ Updated antivirus, ✓ Incident response plan</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> An accounting clerk received an urgent email appearing to be from the CEO, requesting an immediate wire transfer for a "confidential acquisition." The email address was slightly different from the real CEO's address (one letter off).</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> $120,000 transferred to fraudsters, funds unrecoverable.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Implement verification procedures for financial transactions, especially urgent requests.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> ✓ Verify all wire transfer requests via phone, ✓ Implement dual authorization, ✓ Train employees on CEO fraud, ✓ Use email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Case Study 9: The Vendor Compromise</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A retail business was breached through a compromised HVAC vendor's credentials. The vendor had remote access to the business's network for monitoring, and their weak security allowed hackers to use their access as an entry point.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Customer credit card data stolen, $2 million in damages, lawsuits, regulatory fines.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Third-party vendors are potential security risks. Vet vendors' security practices and limit their access.</p>
