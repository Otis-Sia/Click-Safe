                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How often should I change my passwords?</h3>
                <p>We recommend changing passwords for critical accounts (banking, email) every 3-6 months. However, if you use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication, frequent changes are less critical. Change passwords immediately if you suspect a breach.</p>
                
                <h3>Is it safe to use public Wi-Fi?</h3>
                <p>Public Wi-Fi can be risky for sensitive activities. If you must use it, always use a VPN to encrypt your connection. Avoid accessing banking, shopping, or entering passwords on public networks without VPN protection.</p>
                
                <h3>What's the best way to protect my children online?</h3>
                <p>Combine parental controls with education. Use content filters and screen time limits, but also teach children about online safety, privacy, and critical thinking. Maintain open communication so they feel comfortable discussing concerns with you.</p>
                
                <h3>Do I really need antivirus software?</h3>
                <p>Yes, especially for Windows computers. While built-in security (Windows Defender, macOS security) has improved, dedicated antivirus software provides additional protection. For mobile devices, be cautious about app downloads and permissions rather than relying solely on antivirus apps.</p>
                
                <h3>How can I tell if an email is a phishing attempt?</h3>
                <p>Look for red flags: urgent language, requests for personal information, suspicious sender addresses, unexpected attachments, poor grammar, and generic greetings. When in doubt, verify through a separate channel before clicking links or providing information.</p>
                
                <h3>What should I do if I clicked a suspicious link?</h3>
                <p>Act quickly: disconnect from the internet, run a full antivirus scan, change passwords from a different device, monitor accounts for suspicious activity, and enable fraud alerts if financial information may be compromised. Contact your bank if you entered financial details.</p>
                
                <h3>Are password managers safe?</h3>
                <p>Yes, reputable password managers (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden) are very secure and much safer than reusing passwords or writing them down. They use strong encryption and are regularly audited. Choose a strong master password and enable two-factor authentication on the password manager itself.</p>
                
                <h3>How do I secure my smart home devices?</h3>
                <p>Change default passwords immediately, keep firmware updated, use a separate network for IoT devices, disable unnecessary features, and choose devices from reputable manufacturers with good security track records. Review privacy settings regularly.</p>
                
                <h3>What's two-factor authentication and do I need it?</h3>
                <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two forms of verification to access accounts—usually a password plus a code from your phone. Yes, you should enable it on all important accounts (email, banking, social media). It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
                
                <h3>My small business was hacked. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>Immediately: contain the breach by disconnecting affected systems, preserve evidence, notify your IT team or security consultant, change all passwords, notify affected customers as required by law, and file a police report. Then review and update your security measures to prevent future incidents.</p>
